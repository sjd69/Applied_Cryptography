# T7: Token Theft
In T2 we dealt with the possible counterfeit of tokens. However, there is still an issue of tokens being stolen and subsequently used in other servers. A single token should *only* belong to a single user. However, since we must accept that stolen tokens may be a possibility, these tokens should *only* be operable within the server it was created inside. If this is not the case, a single token can be passed from hand to hand across servers to bypass other security mechanisms and allow users permissions that they are not supposed to have.

Individual Server authentication?
